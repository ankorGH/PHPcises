# Thought Process
 
I am thinking of a media sharing where anyone can share image/video of a certain size (preventing using up my free cloudinary account)

Things you can do
- Upload a media
- Search media
- Upload of certain size

What I hope to learn
- Enforce mysql basic crud with php
- mysql pagination
- checking file type and size
- uploading file
