# PHPcises

PHPcises is a clone of all exercises in [gophercises](https://github.com/gophercises).
As I keep refeshing my knowledge in PHP I need to implement something I guess. After all I need to show my future self the fucking code.

<b>PS:</b> Incase you are free time, I will appreciate some code reviews.
